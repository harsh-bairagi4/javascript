//Window --> Basically the whole screen of the browser is called window.

console.log(window);
//So ,all the changes we do or perform are done to the window.
//The real syntax is 
window.console.log("Harsh Bairagi");
//The above line basically means print 'harsh bairagi' on the console which exist in the browser and by browser we means windows, that's why we write window word before every task as all the changes needs to be displayed on the browser or window.

//That's why javascript has written that word by default .

//document 
console.log(document); //Basically here the document means the HTML content.
console.log(document.title); //Here, we are accessing the title of the document.
document.title = "Document Object Model"; // We can even change the title of the document 
document.write("This is Hacked");

//So ,we can manipulate our DOM or the HTML content with the help of javascript.
